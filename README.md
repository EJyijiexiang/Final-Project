#Final-Project
#This is a computer game. My game will involve two elements: coin, and dies. The player can flip a coin at the beginning. If head, they will roll a 6-side die, which may have sides (1,2,3,4,5,6). If tail, they will roll a 4-side die, (1,2,3,4). If the first roll rolled 1,2, or 3, they can roll the same die 3 more times. If the first roll rolled 4,5, or 6, they can roll the same die 2 more times. Each round's roll will be cumulatively calculated. In the end, if the sum is greater than or equal to 10, they won. Otherwise, they lost.
